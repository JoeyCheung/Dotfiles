# Dotfiles

![2018-09-19_144842_1920x1080](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30446022/45889706-1ed44180-bd8f-11e8-9a9e-07ef7399dd8b.png)

# How to install

- Run source install.sh
- After installation run source remove.sh (This gets rid of all of the dotfiles that were created. Don't worry you'll be replacing it with the ones that I have in this repo)
- Run source symlinks.sh (This will run all the dotfiles and connect them to the system)

When running all of these, make sure that all of the dotfiles are moved into the home directory or some commands might not work properly

# Issues

- Try to figure out how to get vim and it's plugins to work properly.
- Make zsh automated to become the default shell.
- Command not found: prompt error after installing then running symlinks
- Make vim the default text editor in ranger
