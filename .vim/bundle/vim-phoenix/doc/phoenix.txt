INTRODUCTION                                     *phoenix* 

This plugin helps you navigate and develop projects using the Phoenix web
framework. A Phoenix project is detected by ascending up the directory
hierarchy until both a `Mix.exs` file and `web` directory are found. When you
edit a file in a Phoenix project, this plugin will be activated. This sets
various options and defines some commands. It also integrates with other Vim
plugins.

=============================================================================
NAVIGATION                                       *phoenix-navigation*

Navigating a phoenix project's many files is what this project is mostly about.
You should first and foremost try to use Vim's own navigation features to get
around your project. To that end, this plugin will tweak a few settings.

First, all common Phoenix code locations are prepended to 'path', enabling you
to use |:find|:
>
	:find page_controller.ex
<
Second, 'suffixesadd' has common Elixir file extensions prependend to it,
allowing you to use |:find| and |gf| to jump to files.

=============================================================================
COMMANDS                                         *phoenix-commands*

:Mix [subcommand]		Invoke Mix with the given subcommand.

                                                 *phoenix-projections*
The |projections| plugin can be used to define navigation commands. This
plugin provides several projections based on Phoenix project layout conventions.
These include:

:Echannel [name]	Edit a file in {web/channels}

:Econtroller [name]	Edit a file in {web/controllers}

:Eview [name]		Edit a file in {web/views}

:Emodel [name]		Edit a file in {web/models}

:Etemplate [name]	Edit a file in {web/templates}

:Erouter		Edit {web/router.ex}

:Estylesheet [name]	Edit a file in {web/static/css}

:Ejavascript [name]	Edit a file in {web/static/js}

:Econfig [name]		Edit a file in {config/}

:Elib [name]		Edit a file in {lib/}

:Emigration [name]	Edit a file in {priv/repo/mgirations}

                                                 *phoenix-snippets*
The |UltiSnips| plugin can help you to quickly inserts commonly used snippets
of code. This plugin adds several Phoenix and Elixir-related snippets, that
will automatically become available in phoenix projects.

See {ultisnips/elixir.snippets} to see what's available.

                                                 *phoenix-surround*
The |surround| plugin allows adding and removing "surrounding" characters,
such as parantheses, quotes and HTML tags. This plugin provides a few helpful
additional surroundings that come in handy when editing `.eex` files:

Key	Surrounding ~
=	<%= ^ %>
-	<% ^ %>
#	<%# ^ %>
<C-E>	<% ^ %>\n<% end -%>
